# AI Component-VanetSim
This is an advanced version of the [VANET simulator](https://svs.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/vanet/index.html) that enables the researcher to employ different artificial intelligence approaches to solve network and supply chains problems. Initially, we tried to employ only evolutionary algorithms on this simulation to reach our research goal. Then we decided to develop this simulator and implement the AI ​​section with more features. Since the software is open source, we decided to deploy it on Github.
## Getting started
